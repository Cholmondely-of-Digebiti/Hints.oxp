This is the first stage of this .oxp

Future hopes:
	1.	GNN newsflashes to amplify a little more along these lines.
	2.	I'd like to add choices of drinks
	3.	Also to add variation and choice in bars (those orbital stations are massive, just one bar is unrealistic).
	4.	I'd also like to "include it" in BeeTLe BeTHLeHeM's Life in the Frontier.oxp
	5.	I desperately want to add in advice for oxp's (which requires this to recognise which oxp's are loaded and then dole out data accordingly)

Notes on License: I'm no jolly good at this sort of thing and only managed thanks to the sustained help of our community. If you pick up this ball and run with it, some token of acknowledgement would be nice, but is not necessary. Just make sure that you do a better job than I did!

	4.	Programming help from Montana05 & phkb
	5.	Inspiration (and bar picture) from BeeTLe BeTHLeHeM

Lots of super ideas from cbr which I'm too dumb to implement!
