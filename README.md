# Hints.oxp
Update of Education.oxp

This gives hints for the vanilla game, and uniquely (as far as I know) uses different colours for the dialogues/trialogues on the so-called mission screens.

The next version (0.94) adds in hints for some of the 700-odd OXPs

Update: with the difficulties in signing in to GitHub, nevermind those involved in eliciting tips for many of these OXP's, this project has pretty much died the death for the nonce. It may very well end up getting included in Massively Locked's revamp of the "Life in the Frontier" OXP
